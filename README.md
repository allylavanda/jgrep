## jgrep

Hello and welcome to my solution I'm working on to add an equivalent tool to grep to windows, jgrep! This is called jgrep since I'll be programming this in java as it is currently my most proficient language. I found that I use windows subsystem for linux on a near daily basis, so I decided to make my own solution for it for fun!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `jgrep/src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `jgrep/bin` folder by default.

## This is being made using JDK21
